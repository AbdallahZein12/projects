Live Chat Website
-----------------

- Flask website that is able to host different rooms for different users. The rooms have unique generated codes that users can join and message each other.
- I used HTML/CSS Python, JS, and the Jinja template to implement python code in my Html. 
- Managed POST and GET responses and used the Flask Framework
